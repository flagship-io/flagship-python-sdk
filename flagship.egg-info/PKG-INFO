        ## Install the library
        
        The python sdk is available on pip package manager. Simply type the following command in your terminal : 
        
        `pip install flagship`
        
        ## Import Flagship in your project
        
        First place the following import at the most apropriate location in your code : 
        
        `from flagship import Flagship`
        
        ## Initialize Flagship
        
        To initialize the library, get an instance of the Flagship class and call the inner start method passing a configuration :
        
        
        `fs = Flagship()
        fs.start(config(env_id))
        `
        
        ## Create a visitor
        
        `visitor = fs.createVisitor(id)`
        
        ## Send a hit
        
        `visitor.sendHit(Event(Event.UserEngagement, 'click_button_kpi'))`
